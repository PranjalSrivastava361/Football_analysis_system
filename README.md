# Football_analysis_system
A computer vision project for football analytics – detecting and tracking players, referees, and the ball using YOLO, clustering teams by jersey colors, measuring ball possession, compensating camera motion with optical flow, applying perspective transformation for real-world measurements, and calculating player speed &amp; distance covered.

## Modules Used

The following modules are used in this project:

- **YOLO**: AI object detection model  
- **KMeans**: Pixel segmentation and clustering to detect t-shirt color  
- **Optical Flow**: Measure camera movement  
- **Perspective Transformation**: Represent scene depth and perspective  
- **Speed & Distance Calculation**: Estimate speed and distance per player
