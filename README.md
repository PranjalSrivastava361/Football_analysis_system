# Football_analysis_system
A computer vision project for football analytics â€“ detecting and tracking players, referees, and the ball using YOLO, clustering teams by jersey colors, measuring ball possession, compensating camera motion with optical flow, applying perspective transformation for real-world measurements, and calculating player speed &amp; distance covered.

#Models Used
The following modules are used in this project:

YOLO: AI object detection model
Kmeans: Pixel segmentation and clustering to detect t-shirt color
Optical Flow: Measure camera movement
Perspective Transformation: Represent scene depth and perspective
Speed and distance calculation per player
